    <h1>How to groom a horse</h1>
    <p>I choose to teach you how to groom a horse because grooming horses is something I do on a 
    daily bases. Plus it's also fun and a great way for you to bond with your horse.</p>
<p> There are 3 steps to grooming a horese the first one is using the curry comb.
The curry comb is small rubber cirlce that you move in circles to bring all the shedded hair
and dirt the surface so you can wipe it away with the other brushes.</p>
<p> The second brush is the hard brush. the hard brush is just like a regular
brush except the bristles are hard. You take the brush in super fast flicking motions to flick all
the dirt and lose hair off the horse.</p>
<p>The 3rd and final step to grooming a horse is the soft brush. The soft brush looks just like the hard brush 
except the bristles are soft. This brush you do long strokes all over the body to make the
coat look nice and soft and shinny. The soft brush is also the only brush you can 
use on the face.</p>
<p> These are the 3 steps to gooming a horse!</p>
